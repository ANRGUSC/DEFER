# DEFER: Distributed Edge Inference for Deep Neural Networks
Performing model inference across multiple edge devices

To use DEFER, run `node.py` on a compute node, and import the `DEFER` class into your main program on the dispatcher node.

Alternatively, try the `test.py` program in the `test` folder.
